      "changelog": "**YAML! And more API methods! With improved erroring! And more!**\r\n\r\nSending data to Slack can now be done with the YAML format, and that data can be sent to [a Slack API method][methods] or [technique of choice](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action/tree/main#sending-techniques) with the provided payload. And additional configurations can improve error handling or customize values between steps.\r\n\r\nBreaking changes happen with this update and recommended migration strategies are detailed below. Adding this step to new workflows might prefer to follow the [`README`](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action/tree/main#slack-send-github-action) instead :books:\r\n\r\n## What's changed\r\n\r\nBoth inputs of payload variables, techniques for sending the payload, additional configurations, and expected outputs were changed:\r\n\r\n- **Sending variables**\r\n  - Breaking changes\r\n    - [Only one payload input can be provided](#only-one-payload-input-can-be-provided)\r\n    - [Only one technique to send can be provided](#only-one-technique-to-send-can-be-provided)\r\n    - [Variable replacements no longer happen by default](#variable-replacements-no-longer-happen-by-default)\r\n    - [Payload file path parsed option was removed](#payload-file-path-parsed-option-was-removed)\r\n  - Enhancements\r\n    - [Payloads can now be written in YAML](#payloads-can-now-be-written-in-yaml)\r\n    - [Payload can now be written in unwrapped JSON](#payload-can-now-be-written-in-unwrapped-json)\r\n- **Sending techniques**\r\n  - Technique 1: Slack Workflow Builder\r\n    - Breaking changes\r\n      - [The webhook type must be specified in webhook inputs](#the-webhook-type-must-be-specified-in-webhook-inputs)\r\n      - [Payload flattening no longer happens by default](#payload-flattening-no-longer-happens-by-default)\r\n    - Enhancements\r\n      - [The webhook URL can be specified in webhook inputs](#the-webhook-url-can-be-specified-in-webhook-inputs)\r\n  - Technique 2: Slack API method\r\n    - Breaking changes\r\n      - [The Slack API method now must be specified in inputs](#the-slack-api-method-now-must-be-specified-in-inputs)\r\n      - [A token must be provided with other inputs](#a-token-must-be-provided-with-other-inputs)\r\n      - [Inputs to the Slack API method must be provided in payloads](#inputs-to-the-slack-api-method-must-be-provided-in-payloads)\r\n      - [Messages cannot be sent to multiple channels in one step](#messages-cannot-be-sent-to-multiple-channels-in-one-step)\r\n  - Technique 3: Slack incoming webhook\r\n    - Breaking changes\r\n      - [The webhook type must be specified for incoming webhooks](#the-webhook-type-must-be-specified-for-incoming-webhooks)\r\n    - Enhancements\r\n      - [The webhook URL can be specified for incoming webhook](#the-webhook-url-can-be-specified-for-incoming-webhooks)\r\n- **Additional configurations**\r\n  - Enhancements\r\n    - [Steps can exit with an error after a failed Slack API call](#steps-can-exit-with-an-error-after-a-failed-slack-api-call)\r\n    - [Failed requests can be retried various amounts of times](#failed-requests-can-be-retried-various-amounts-of-times)\r\n    - [Provided payloads can be flattened with a delimiter](#provided-payloads-can-be-flattened-with-a-delimiter)\r\n    - [Provided payloads can have templated variables replaced](#provided-payloads-can-have-templated-variables-replaced)\r\n    - [Proxying HTTPS requests can be done within inputs](#proxying-https-requests-can-be-done-within-inputs)\r\n- **Expected outputs**\r\n  - Breaking changes\r\n    - [The time value is now returned as the Unix epoch time](#the-time-value-is-now-returned-as-the-unix-epoch-time)\r\n  - Enhancements\r\n    - [An ok value is added to represent response success](#an-ok-value-is-added-to-represent-response-success)\r\n    - [A response value is added with the response data](#a-response-value-is-added-with-the-response-data)\r\n\r\nThe following sections detail these changes with recommended changes for existing GitHub workflows using this step and certain features.\r\n\r\nIf something seems off after making these changes, please feel free to [open an issue][issues] for discussion! 👾\r\n\r\n## Sending variables\r\n\r\nThe source of variables remains the same, using one of the following inputs:\r\n\r\n- `payload`: Inputs written inline in your GitHub workflow file.\r\n- `payload-file-path`: Inputs gathered from a file.\r\n- **No input**: Uses the default event [context][event-context] with a [payload][event-payload] matching the GitHub event.\r\n\r\n### :warning: Breaking changes\r\n\r\n<div id=\"only-one-payload-input-can-be-provided\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### Only one payload input can be provided\r\n\r\nThis Action now exits with an error if both `payload` and `payload-file-path` are provided.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Both options could be provided with `payload` being preferred.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Use either `payload`, `payload-file-path`, or neither, when providing inputs. But don't include both.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"only-one-technique-to-send-can-be-provided\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### Only one technique to send can be provided\r\n\r\nThis Action now exits with an error if both `method` and `webhook` techniques are provided.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Both techniques could be used to send the same payload.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Use either `method` or `webhook` to send data, but not both.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"variable-replacements-no-longer-happen-by-default\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### Variable replacements no longer happen by default\r\n\r\nThis Action now sends payload provided in a `payload-file-path` file exactly as is.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Templatized variables in input files were replaced with the matching `github` or `env` variable:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"channel\": \"${{ env.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}\",\r\n  \"text\": \"A commit was made: ${{ github.sha }}\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the above file into something like this before being sent:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"channel\": \"C0123456789\",\r\n  \"text\": \"A commit was made: 3982e204d2ae590e908dd1e279e63933da566c8c\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: To continue replacing templated variables provided from the step `env` or default GitHub event [context][event-context] and [payload][event-payload], set the `payload-templated` variable to `true`.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"payload-file-path-parsed-option-was-removed\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### Payload file path parsed option was removed\r\n\r\nThis Action removed the `payload-file-path-parsed` input option.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: This option, which defaulted to `true`, could be set to `false` to avoid replacing templatized variables in a provided `payload-file-path` file.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Remove this option if it's set to `false` or set the new `payload-templated` option to `true` to continue parsing the provided payload.\r\n\r\n### 🎁 Enhancements\r\n\r\n<div id=\"payloads-can-now-be-written-in-yaml\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### Payloads can now be written in YAML\r\n\r\nThis Action now supports writing `payload` or `payload-file-path` values with YAML!\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Values provided as payloads had to be JSON.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Optional. Format the input `payload` value as YAML to match the surrounding steps:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: Post to a Slack channel\r\n  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2.0.0\r\n  with:\r\n    method: chat.postMessage\r\n    token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}\r\n    payload: |\r\n      channel: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}\r\n      text: \"Greetings <@channel>!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<div id=\"payload-can-now-be-written-in-unwrapped-json\"></div>\r\n\r\n#### Payload can now be written in unwrapped JSON\r\n\r\nThis Action now supports writing `payload` with unwrapped JSON, where surrounding braces are removed.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Values provided as payloads had to be JSON.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Optional. Remove the surrounding braces from an existing `payload` value:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: Post to a Slack channel\r\n  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2.0.0\r\n  with:\r\n    method: chat.postMessage\r\n    token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}\r\n    payload: |\r\n      \"channel\": \"${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}\",\r\n      \"text\": \"Greetings <@channel>!\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sending techniques\r\n\r\nThe techniques for sending variables remains the same, using one of the following:\r\n\r\n- **Technique 1**: [Slack Workflow Builder][wfb]\r\n- **Technique 2**: [Slack API method][methods]\r\n- **Technique 3**: [Slack incoming webhook][incoming-webhook]\r\n\r\nChanges for different technique might be different and are included in each of the following sections.\r\n\r\n### Technique 1: Slack Workflow Builder\r\n\r\n#### ⚠️ Breaking changes\r\n\r\n<div id=\"the-webhook-type-must-be-specified-in-webhook-inputs\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### The webhook type must be specified in webhook inputs\r\n\r\nThis Action now requires setting the `webhook-type` as a step input value.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: The webhook type could be omitted to send to Workflow Builder.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Set the `webhook-type` value to `webhook-trigger`, as shown in the example below.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"payload-flattening-no-longer-happens-by-default\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### Payload flattening no longer happens by default\r\n\r\nThis Action no longer flattens or stringifies payloads being sent to Workflow Builder by default.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Payloads sent using a webhook trigger were flattened with a `.` delimiter and have values stringified before being sent.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: If payload flattening is needed, use the `payload-delimiter` option. Inputs of Slack workflows should use an underscore `_` as a delimiter to match expected inputs of Workflow Builder:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: Send GitHub Action data to a Slack workflow\r\n  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2.0.0\r\n  with:\r\n    payload-delimiter: \"_\"\r\n    webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}\r\n    webhook-type: webhook-trigger\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 🎁 Enhancements\r\n\r\n<div id=\"the-webhook-url-can-be-specified-in-webhook-inputs\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### The webhook URL can be specified in webhook inputs\r\n\r\nThis Action can now set the `webhook` URL as a step input.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: The `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable set this value.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Optional. Use the `webhook` input value, as shown above, to set the webhook URL.\r\n\r\n### Technique 2: Slack API methods\r\n\r\nThis technique can now send to [the Slack API methods][methods] and supports all [token][tokens] types!\r\n\r\n#### ⚠️ Breaking changes\r\n\r\n<div id=\"the-slack-api-method-now-must-be-specified-in-inputs\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### The Slack API method now must be specified in inputs\r\n\r\nThis Action now requires that [the Slack API method][methods] is specified in inputs.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Messages would be posted using `chat.postMessage` or `chat.update` behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n**Recommend change**: Use the `method` that matches the message being posted, or use a different method:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: Post to a Slack channel\r\n  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2.0.0\r\n  with:\r\n    method: chat.postMessage\r\n    token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}\r\n    payload: |\r\n      channel: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}\r\n      text: \"Greetings <@channel>!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Steps with `update-ts` should use `chat.update` as the `method`.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"a-token-must-be-provided-with-other-inputs\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### A token must be provided with other inputs\r\n\r\nThis Action expects a [`token`][tokens] as a step input value.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Bot tokens were provided with the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Provide the `token` scoped for the method as a step input, as shown above. The `SLACK_TOKEN` environment variable can also be used.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"inputs-to-the-slack-api-method-must-be-provided-in-payloads\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### Inputs to the Slack API method must be provided in payloads\r\n\r\nThis Action now passes all provided values for payloads to the Slack API method.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: The `channel-id` and `slack-message` values were used.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Include the values sent to the Slack API method in the provided payload, as shown above.\r\n\r\n<div id=\"messages-cannot-be-sent-to-multiple-channels-in-one-step\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### Messages cannot be sent to multiple channels in one step\r\n\r\nThis Action can no longer send messages to multiple channels.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: Multiple channels could be provided to `channel-id`.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Update your GitHub workflow to repeat the same `chat.postMessage` step multiple times with different channel IDs.\r\n\r\n### Technique 3: Slack incoming webhook\r\n\r\n#### ⚠️ Breaking changes\r\n\r\n<div id=\"the-webhook-type-must-be-specified-for-incoming-webhooks\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### The webhook type must be specified for incoming webhooks\r\n\r\nThis Action now requires setting the `webhook-type` as a step input value.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: The webhook type could be omitted to send to Workflow Builder.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Set the `webhook-type` value to `incoming-webhook`, as shown in the example below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: Post a message in a channel\r\n  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v2.0.0\r\n  with:\r\n    webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}\r\n    webhook-type: incoming-webhook\r\n    payload: |\r\n      text: \"Greetings from this step!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 🎁 Enhancements\r\n\r\n<div id=\"the-webhook-url-can-be-specified-for-incoming-webhooks\"></div>\r\n\r\n##### The webhook URL must be specified for incoming webhooks\r\n\r\nThis Action can now set the `webhook` URL as a step input.\r\n\r\n**Prior to updating**: The `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable set this value.\r\n\r\n**Recommended change**: Optional.

      "changelog": "## What's Changed\r\nThis release contains the following breaking changes:\r\n1) The ability to apply labels based on the names of base and/or head branches was added ([#186](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/186) and [#54](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/54)). The match object for changed files was expanded with new combinations in order to make it more intuitive and flexible ([#423](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/423) and [#101](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/101)). As a result, the configuration file structure was significantly redesigned and is not compatible with the structure of the previous version. Please read the [action documentation](https://github.com/actions/labeler/tree/main#pull-request-labeler) to find out how to adapt your configuration files for use with the new action version.\r\n\r\n2) The bug related to the `sync-labels` input was fixed ([#112](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/112)).
