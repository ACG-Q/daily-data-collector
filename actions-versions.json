      "changelog": "## What's Changed\r\nThis release contains the following breaking changes:\r\n1) The ability to apply labels based on the names of base and/or head branches was added ([#186](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/186) and [#54](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/54)). The match object for changed files was expanded with new combinations in order to make it more intuitive and flexible ([#423](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/423) and [#101](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/101)). As a result, the configuration file structure was significantly redesigned and is not compatible with the structure of the previous version. Please read the [action documentation](https://github.com/actions/labeler/tree/main#pull-request-labeler) to find out how to adapt your configuration files for use with the new action version.\r\n\r\n2) The bug related to the `sync-labels` input was fixed ([#112](https://github.com/actions/labeler/issues/112)). Now the input value is read correctly.\r\n\r\n3) By default, `dot` input is set to `true`. Now, paths starting with a dot (e.g. `.github`) are matched by default.\r\n\r\n4) Version 5 of this action updated the [runtime to Node.js 20](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions).
